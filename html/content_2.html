                <h3>MARINE PLASTIC POLLUTION</h3>
                <p>Plastic is a synthetic, organic polymer made from petroleum with properties ideally suited for a wide variety of applications including: packaging, building and construction, household and sports equipment, vehicles, electronics, and agriculture. Over 300 million tons of plastic are produced every year, half of which is used to create single-use items such as shopping bags, cups and straws. If discarded improperly, plastic waste can harm the environment and biodiversity.</p>
                <p>
                    The main sources of plastic debris found in the ocean are land-based, coming from urban and stormwater runoff, sewer overflows, littering, inadequate waste disposal and management, industrial activities, tyre abrasion, construction and illegal dumping. Ocean-based plastic pollution originates primarily from the fishing industry, nautical activities and aquaculture.</p>
                <p>Under the influence of solar UV radiation, wind, currents and other natural factors, plastic breaks down into small particles called microplastics (particles smaller than 5 mm) or nanoplastics (particles smaller than 100 nm). The small size makes them easy for marine life to ingest accidentally.</p>

            <h3>How this affect to the Humans</h3>
            <h2>Impacts on food and human health</h2>
            <p>Microplastics have been found in tap water, beer, salt and are present in all samples collected in the world’s oceans, including the Arctic. Several chemicals used in the production of plastic materials are known to be carcinogenic and to interfere with the body’s endocrine system, causing developmental, reproductive, neurological, and immune disorders in both humans and wildlife. Recently, microplastics were found in human placentas but more research is needed to determine if this is a widespread problem.</p>
            <p>Toxic contaminants also accumulate on the surface of plastic as a result of prolonged exposure to seawater. When marine organisms ingest plastic debris, these contaminants enter their digestive systems, and over time accumulate in the food web. The transfer of contaminants between marine species and humans through consumption of seafood has been identified as a health hazard, and research is ongoing.</p>
            <h2>Impacts on climate change</h2>
            <p>Marine plastic pollution has multifaceted impacts on climate change, stemming from its lifecycle and interactions with the environment. Firstly, the production of plastic entails the extraction and processing of fossil fuels, leading to substantial greenhouse gas emissions. From drilling oil for raw materials to refining and manufacturing processes, each stage releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants into the atmosphere, exacerbating global warming. Additionally, the disposal of plastic waste further contributes to emissions. Incineration, a common method of waste management, releases carbon dioxide and methane, both potent greenhouse gases, into the air.</p>
            <p>Beyond emissions, marine plastics affect the ocean's ability to regulate climate through various mechanisms. Plastics alter the carbon cycle by absorbing and releasing gases, disrupting the exchange of carbon dioxide between the ocean and the atmosphere. This disturbance can impede the ocean's capacity to sequester carbon, exacerbating the greenhouse effect. Moreover, large accumulations of plastic debris alter oceanic dynamics. They can disrupt currents and circulation patterns, which play crucial roles in redistributing heat and nutrients across the globe. Alterations to these processes can have cascading effects on climate systems, influencing weather patterns and ocean temperatures.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, marine plastics impact ecosystems that are integral to climate regulation. Coral reefs, for instance, provide habitat for diverse marine life and support fisheries while sequestering carbon dioxide. Plastics pose a threat to coral health, leading to degradation and loss of these vital ecosystems. Similarly, microplastics are ingested by marine organisms, entering the food chain and potentially bioaccumulating harmful chemicals. This disrupts the balance of marine ecosystems, affecting carbon cycling and nutrient dynamics, which are essential for regulating climate.</p>
            <p>In summary, marine plastic pollution contributes to climate change through its lifecycle emissions, disruption of oceanic processes, and degradation of ecosystems crucial for climate regulation. Addressing this issue requires comprehensive strategies to reduce plastic production, improve waste management practices, and mitigate the impacts on marine environments. By addressing marine plastic pollution, we can help mitigate climate change and preserve the health of our oceans for future generations.</p>
            <h2>Impacts on tourism</h2>
            <p>Plastic waste damages the aesthetic value of tourist destinations, leading to decreased income from tourism. It also generates major economic costs related to the cleaning and maintenance of the sites. The build-up of plastic litter on beaches can have a negative impact on a country’s economy, wildlife, and the physical and psychological wellbeing of people.</p>
