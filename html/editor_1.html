        <h1>Role - Student 1</h1>
        <p>I've taken on the role of student number one. As previously mentioned, I created a splash screen that
            automatically directs to the homepage after 4 seconds, followed by designing the shop page. Additionally, I
            made the article page on coral conservation, pertinent to the discussion of "Life Below Water".</p>

        <h1>Home page</h1>
        <p>As previously stated, our group selected the "Life Below Water" topic, leading to several discussions on
            website design. We agreed on a unified theme color for our site, which Student 2 implemented when creating
            the homepage..</p>
